Title: Dependency Discovery via Multiscale Graph Correlation

Abstract: Determining how certain properties are related to other properties is fundamental to scientific discovery; further investigations into the geometry of the relationship and future predictions are warranted only if two properties are significantly related. To better discover any type of relationship underlying paired sample data, we introduce the multiscale graph correlation (MGC), which combines distance correlation, the locality principle, and smoothed maximum to yield a new and powerful dependency measure.
We prove that MGC is consistent for testing independence, enjoys a number of desirable theoretical properties, exhibits empirical power advantages against a wide range of nonlinear and high-dimensional dependencies, and can be efficiently implemented and utilized for real data exploration.



Title: Distance-Based Dependence Measure and its Applications

Abstract: Determining how certain properties are related to other properties is fundamental to scientific discovery; further investigations into the geometry of the relationship and future predictions are warranted only if two properties are significantly related. 
In this talk I will introduce some recent distance and kernel based dependency measures, present the theoretical properties and advantages over traditional correlation measures, along with supporting simulations and an application to extract signal brain region from fMRI brain images.
